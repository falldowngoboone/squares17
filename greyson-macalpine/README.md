# By the People, for the People: Designing for the Real Life

## Take care of the designer (you)
This allows you to be better at your job, be more productive, feel better about what you do, etc.

### Pay attention to your environment
* Do you feel welcomed in your workplace or is there a consistent attitude of dismissiveness or even downright hostility because of unresolved resentment?
* Are you noticing other teammates slacking in their performance because of lack of support or accountability?
* Are you experiencing health issues as a result of chronic anxiety, stress, and depression?

## Learn by doing.
* Don’t wait
* It’s about being okay with your journey

## Stay uncomfortable and curious
* Debate is good
* Remain humble
* Cultivate your sense of curiosity
* Being uncomfortable causes you to grow

## Design is not art
* Design is about functionality
* Design is for other people, art is for the artist
* Be sure your design is solving a problem and isn’t just beautiful art

## Some research is better than none
* Defend research to the client
* It makes sure you’re designing for the correct problem and user
* Research can actually reduce cost in the long run

## They’re not just users, they’re also people
* Don’t forget to see people through the lens of humanity, not just metrics and data points

## Embrace diversity
* Diversity makes you better suited for solving a wider variety of problems

## Empathy
* Empathy is a tool that will help you gain insight
* Emotional empathy is what’s usually touted as the type of empathy that designers must use, but it can be exhausting and counterproductive
* Cognitive empathy (there are several types of empathy) -> “perspective-taking”
* The practice of putting aside your ego to gain deeper insight

## Listen
* Be aware of your own emotional state and put this aside
* Be open to what the person is saying regardless of your own personal beliefs and values
* This puts the focus on people and not just ideas to research
* Compassion does not require emotional transference to understand the other person
* Emotional empathy is inherently biased - What about the people we can’t relate to?
* Compassion is caring because it’s the right thing to do, no matter who the person is.
