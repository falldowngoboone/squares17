# Build Something Today
Andrew Norcross

*RB - Okay, the one thing I've always had trouble with is figuring out what to code. That's why I like things like freeCodeCamp and the like. I would love to find more places that offer up project prompts.*

The biggest reason don't release their code is they feel like they're not good enough.

Criticsm of your code isn't a criticism of you.

**Start writing now**

**Start releasing soon**

It's been proven many times that doing is the best way to learn.

>Just take an idea that you have and learn what you need to build it as you go. When it comes to building websites, there is no one-true-way. Enjoy the journey.

Put one thing up. Take one thing you've built. Tweet about it. Invite other people to look at it.

*RB - I've pushed things live, but not really invited others to look at it.*
