# Design is Not Art
Austin Knight

"Everybody thinks they're a designer. I'm the designer here, and I'm the expert."

The genius designer myth

* They _know_ what will work; they don't have to test
* The need no prior knowledge to design the perfect application

## The differences between design and art

### Art
#### Purposes
* Personal expression - has intrinsic and independent value
* Provocation - makes you think, generates friction, for better or worse
* Exploration - it is whimsical
* Appreciation - a reflection of its creator

#### Data sources
* the artist him/herself

#### Role of creativity
* Subjective
* Creative for the sake of being creative (end result)

### Design
#### Purposes
* Use - has extrinsic and dependent value
* Alleviation - makes you think less, reduces friction, for better or worse
* Observation and iteration - it is calculated
* Function - reflection of its audience

#### Data sources
* mainly from external sources

#### Role of creativity
* (Increasingly) objective
* Creative for the sake of serving a pupose or solving a problem (means to an end result)

Design overlaps engineering (function) and art (aesthetic)

`Function + Aesthetic = Delight`

Function is the critical element; aeshtetics should both be derived from and assist in the function.

Functional & Aesthetically Pleasing = most likely to win (Spotify)
Functional & Not Aesthetically Pleasing = can still win (Reddit)
Not Functional & Aesthetically Pleasing = not likely to win (Ello)

Strong aeshtetic design accounts for what the user perceives as beauty more than what the designer perceives as beauty.

>Leave room for the user's self-expression.
- Deiter Rams

The user should be at the center of the function and aesthetics of the product.

Design is not **about the designer**

## The incompatibilities between design and ego

Feedback and emotion attachment - if the designer is enmeshed with the design, any criticism is seen as a personal indictment

Attribution of success and failure - if a product succeeds, it's because of the designer themself; if it fails, it's someone else's fault (or, perhaps they take on the blame completely and are trying to shirk responsibility)

Data and validation - big egos look for data that backs up what they believe, ingnore everything else

Open-mindedness - big egos are narrow-minded

Collaboration and teamwork - big egos don't want collaboration; teams hate big egos

**Humility is the most important quality a designer can possess**

Another take on designers vs. artists: Artists find a story/problem and tell it/solve it. Designers are solving other people's problems and tell other people's stories.
