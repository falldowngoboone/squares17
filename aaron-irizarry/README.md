# Hold Fast: Managing design teams when projects go sideways
Aaron Irizarry

> Tech companies are expected to move at an incredible pace, but building software is complex.
> - Alex Schleifer, Air BnB

## These companies are complex for a variety of reasons…
* Departmental make up
* Internal politics
* Team distribution
* Differing understanding of design’s role
* Limited budget and lofty goals

Once we start to understand these contexts better, we an start to get an idea of what warning signs to look for before, during and after projectgs

Shipping is just the beginning.

This sounds a lot like project management...
It is.
You are responsible for getting work out the door

As design managers we should put equal amount of effort into "contingency plans" for when things go sideways as we do our designs and project plans.

Almost every problem we run into with rpojects can be traced back to **communication issues** with our cross functional teams about the projects and processes that surround them.

## Relationship management
* Managing Stakeholders
* Managing Our Teams
* Managing The Process

## Managing Stakeholders

Start by striving for transparency

Take responsibility.

Avoid unnecessary confilct with teams and team members, you can call things was you see them while still moving towards a positive resolution.
Are the words I'm about to say going to move the situation toward a positive resolution?

Admit when you don't have an answer.

We need to build trust

Focusing on other people insteasd of solution to the problem at hand, only leads to additional conflict and away from a problem's resolution.

We have to get better as shutting up and listening.

## Managing our teams

Every experience, good or bad, our teams face will change them
No team comes out of any experience the same

This is okay

Ovservation is such an important part of our design process, but it is often overlooked as an important part of how we manage and support our teams.

**Weekly one-on-one meetings**

* Non-cancelable, but reschedulable
* Not just a status update (talk about obstacles, how to remove anything in the way of accomplishment)

It's not enough to just manage our teams during challenging project sitouations, if we want to be successful, and more importantly, help our teams be successful we need to lead

## Managing the Process

Document the process
Make it easy to access to everyone
Use the process as goals for review

* Having an agreed upon process in place will provide a starting point
* Be prepared to ditch your process
* Remaining flexible is the key to weathering storms
* Have a plan B, plan C, etc

There is ideal and there is real
We can't control what comes our way, but we can control how we respond.
