# Vague But Exciting

We're not losing fidelity, we're enhancing what's important.
As you enhance what's important, it becomes something that's vague, something that other people project their ideas on.

Storyboards exist because animation is expensive.
Pitch Doctor - software that allows Pixar to do lo-fi story prototypes

## Nintendo

### Mario 64
While developing Mario 64, they didn't have the actual hardware.
Miyamoto quote (photo roll)
They had a design system.
They spent half the time designing the movement, animation and physics.
The courses and enemies were all done at the end, thrown together!

>We get the fundamentals solid first, then do as much with that core concept as our time and ambition will allow.
- Shigeru Miyamoto

Hand response, game feel, is the most important thing.

### Splattoon
Started out as a lo-fi design (blocks of tofu)

>The way that Miyamoto-san [makes] games, the idea comes not from the design, but from the function. The design comes after.
- Satoru Iwata

### Zelda: Breath of the Wild
Started as a 2D prototype (ala The Legend of Zelda).

They came up with a chemistry engine.

>That experiement showed us how great the title could be, but also the amount of work required to make it.
- Hidemaro Fujibayashi

Prototypes help not only figure out behavior, but also how much work a project will require.

## Blizzard

### Overwatch
New character created through mixing up parts of existing characters.

>A combination of cobbled together parts. But it was instantly fun. And that's how we knew...
-Jeff Kaplan, Game Direcotr of Overwatch

Practice good risk managemnt techniques.

>...prescribe to an iterative develpment process, and utilize prototypes as a method of proving features and concepts before committing them to your design.

Don't be overly ambitious in your design.

>Find out if it's a dumb idea as soon as possible

## Google

### <cite>Sprint</cite> by Jake Knapp, Google Ventures
* Mon - Map out the problem
* Tue - Sketch out ideas to solve the problem (everyone in the room)
* Wed - Decide which sketches you like
* Thu - Prototype in one day (Keynote recommended)
* Fri - Test

### Daydream VR
* Build on Mon and Tue
* Document what they learned on Wed and Thu
* Get together on Fri and test with users

>80% is better than 90%

The more polished something gets, the more nitpicky people get.

>You build the tip of the iceberg and people will come to you with the rest.

## Paravel

>Prototypes not powerpoints

### Prototyping tools
* Bootstrap
* Foundation
* Codepen - easy to share and get feedback
* Jekyll for websites
    * Open Source
    * An Actual Site
    * Real Data - uses JSON in templates
* Ngrok.com - tunnel to a computer for testing
* Sketching (pen and paper)

Be flexible in your design. Save time by reusing pieces. (Global Defense)
Share your process. Share your work.

>The fidelity of your prototype should match the fidelity of your thinking.
-Jared Spool, Shop Talk Show #138

Prototyping should be part of the formal process.
